# GitLab, GitLab Runners, Autoscaling, Caching - on cloudscale.ch

ðŸ’¡ A guide and Ansible playbook for running GitLab on cloudscale.ch, together
with autoscaled runners and distributed caching.

## Introduction

We are heavy users of GitLab, and so are many of our customers. One feature a
lot of our customers use, is autoscaling GitLab runners. With them, CI capacity
is added automatically when needed, and removed when it is not.

This is precisely where a cloud is best: You get the resources when you
need them, and do not pay for them, when you don't. The compute usage at
cloudscale.ch is billed to-the-second, and CI usage is highly variable.

This repository explains how to configure GitLab to use autoscaling GitLab
runners with cloudscale.ch. Additionally, it includes the use of distributed
caching, which is often desirable when using many CI runners.

Below, you will find two approaches:

ðŸš€ A playbook contained in this repository will help you set up GitLab, and
   GitLab Runners automatically. You can use this to get started, or to take
   the setup for a test-drive.

ðŸ“• Documentation on how to set this up yourself. This approach is useful when
   you already use GitLab, or have a different configuration and deployment
   method.

Note: Though it is possible to use your own runners for the GitLab SaaS
product, we focus on managed GitLab.

## ðŸš€ Setup With Ansible Playbook

To use the playbook provided in this repository, you need the following:

* A Python virtual environment.
* A cloudscale.ch API token (with write permission).

### Preparing Your Virtual Environment

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudscale-ch/gitlab-autoscale
cd gitlab-autoscale
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Preparing Your API Key

To create a new API token:

1. Login to https://control.cloudscale.ch.
2. Select the project you want to use.
3. Select "API Tokens" in the menu.
4. Create an API token with "Write Access".

Before continuing, configure your environment to use this key:

```bash
export CLOUDSCALE_API_TOKEN="..."
```

### Configure Your Instance

Create your own version of the example configuration, and adjust it to your
liking:

```bash
cp config-example.yml config.yml
```

At minimum, you need to set the following:

- `ssh_keys` (add your SSH public key).
- `lets_encrypt_contact` (an e-mail address for Let's Encrypt certificates).

### Create Your Instance

Run the following playbook, to create a GitLab VM, install GitLab, and
configure a GitLab Runner on it, responsible for managing other runners:

```bash
playbooks/gitlab-autoscale.yml
```

The so installed GitLab Runner does not run any jobs of its own. Instead, it
is co-located on the GitLab server, where it ensures that queued jobs are
worked on by autoscaled workers.

Have a look at the source code, to see how everything is put together. The
different elements are organized into sections that should be easy to follow.

### Additional Information

To test your new setup, see [Test Drive](#test-drive).

To read about additional considerations, see [Additional Considerations](#additional-considerations).

## ðŸ“• Manual Setup

To get started, you should install GitLab according to GitLab's offical
documentation:

https://about.gitlab.com/install/

Next, you need at least one GitLab runner, that is always on. This runner
will be responsible for launching other runners, as needed. It can be run
anywhere, and it can also run its own jobs.

A good option to not have to use extra resources for this runner, is to
simply install it on the same host as your GitLab server. In this case you
want a runner that has no other jobs (or its CI jobs will compete with your
GitLab server for resources).

Either way, the following applies whether you install this runner on your GitLab
server host, or in a dedicated VM or container.

### Install GitLab Runner

There are multiple ways to install GitLab runner:

https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/

We recommend using a distro-specific package, as it makes updates easier:

https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/linux-repository.html

Please note that the step "Register a runner" should be skipped, as this will
be done with a more specific call further down.

### Install Docker Machine

GitLab runner uses Docker Machine, to launch VMs and to run the GitLab runner
container on it. Though Docker Machine is deprecated by Docker Inc., there is
currently no better alternative.

GitLab maintains a fork of Docker Machine, that is going to be supported, until
a better solution is provided.

To install, you simply run the following commands on your VM:

```bash
sudo curl -L https://gitlab-docker-machine-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/v0.16.2-gitlab.19/docker-machine-Linux-x86_64 \
-o /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
```

Additionally, you'll need the cloudscale.ch driver for Docker Machine:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/cloudscale-ch/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale/releases/download/v1.2.1/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale_1.2.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz \
| tar xz docker-machine-driver-cloudscale

sudo mv docker-machine-driver-cloudscale /usr/local/bin/
```

You can check the following repositories to get the latest releases:

- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/docker-machine
- https://github.com/cloudscale-ch/docker-machine-driver-cloudscale

### Acquire GitLab Runner Registration Token

To register your runner, you need to get a registration token. This can be
a global token (to create a shared runner), or a project-specific token.

For a shared runner, open the admin dashboard at `/admin`, and select "Runners"
on your left (`/admin/runners`). Clicking on "Register an instance runner"
allows you to view and copy the registration token.

### Register GitLab Runner

The following command will register the GitLab Runner, and configure it
to autoscale CI jobs using ephemeral runner instances. Run this on the VM
you have installed your runner on:

```bash
# The token that will be used to create new runners
export CLOUDSCALE_API_TOKEN="..."

# The flavor to use for autoscale GitLab runners
export CLOUDSCALE_FLAVOR="flex-8-4"

# Your GitLab instance
export GITLAB_URL="https://..."

# The token to register runners with
export GITLAB_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN="..."

sudo gitlab-runner register \
   --non-interactive \
   --url "$GITLAB_URL" \
   --registration-token "$GITLAB_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN" \
   --run-untagged \
   --executor "docker+machine" \
   --docker-image ubuntu \
   --description "GitLab Runner Manager" \
   --machine-machine-driver cloudscale \
   --machine-machine-name 'autoscale-%s' \
   --machine-machine-options "cloudscale-token=$CLOUDSCALE_API_TOKEN" \
   --machine-machine-options "cloudscale-flavor=$CLOUDSCALE_FLAVOR"
```

Having done this, open the `/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml` file, and change
the `concurrent = 1` value to a higher value. The number you select, is the
maximum number of runners started in parallel.

After editing the file, run `sudo systemctl restart gitlab-runner`.

## ðŸ’¡ Additional Information

### Test Drive

To run a simple CI job on your new setup, you can login to your GitLab
instance, create an empty project, and then use "Web IDE" to add a new file.

Select `.gitlab-ci.yml`. and pick the `Bash` template. It won't really do
anything useful, but if you commit it, the job should be run on a VM managed
by your new GitLab setup!

### Additional Considerations

#### Docker Image Cache

GitLab recommends the use of a pull-through cache for the Docker registry.
This is useful if you are hitting rate-limits when accessing docker images.

We currently don't cover this in this guide. Let us know if you want us to, and
we'll be happy to add additional information.

Here's the guide by GitLab on this subject:

https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/speed_up_job_execution.html#docker-hub-registry-mirror

A good approach would be to put this cache on a VM with private network, which
the runners could access.

You can also use alternative registries, or login to the Docker Hub before using
it, which yields a higher rate limit. See the following StackOverflow answer
on how to set up GitLab runner to authenticate to a Docker registry, before
pulling images:
